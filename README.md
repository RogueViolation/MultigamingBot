# MultigamingBot
Personal Discord Bot

## Why?
Because I like coding and learning to do so as a hobby.

## What does it do?
It allows me to automatically redeem codes for a video game server since I do not like doing it manually.
I am also going to add a very rudimentary OSRS XP gain tracker to the bot as it expands the tech stack of the solution :)
